# US_IND_IT_COVID19

Covid-19 pandemic has left us sheltered in our homes. Various news media report the ever-increasing trends in the number of cases and more frightening: the number of deaths. The various news media also report fancy terms like exponential trends, flattening the curve and several more buzz-words which can be overwhelming if this is the first time you have heard such terms. It's hard, not to feel panicked. I, personally, have found it difficult to explain to the elderly family members what these terms mean.

Hence, I decided to put together some interactive plots which shows the Covid-19 statistics for some countries of my interest:

1) The United States of America - I live here. The United States seems to have beaten the Covid-19 waves successfully.

2) Kenya - In headlines recently, with the delta variant of the Covid-19 virus spreading here rapidly.

3) Uganda - In a similar situation as Kenya with cases going up alarmlingly!

4) India - A majority of my family lives here and the country has ben hit by one of the worst second wave of infections!

5) Italy - I lived and worked here just before the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Italy was the first country in Europe with severe number of COVID-19 cases, but seems to have handled the situation well, for now.
